beware
of
sales
staff
I
had
talked
with
the
sales
staff
about

an
event
delightful

great
location

hotel
good
location

this
hotel

excellent

a
very
good
deal
modern
boutique

This
is
a
really
nice
place
to
stay
in
Shanghai

this
hotel

three
nights
peaceful
and
comfortable
four
star
hotel

the
price
excellent
customer
service

i
read
the
previous
comments
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
I
had
a
different
experience
staff
was
very
proactive
and
educated
willing
to
help
all
the
time
the
room
was
good
for
the
price
location
in
downtown
you
cannot
beat
that
i
know
it
is
not
the
place
on
earth
but
they
are
trying
to
provide
a
clean
and
good
service
ideal
definetely
come
back
to
the
abigail
hotel
and
i
hope
that
you
do
so
too
it
is
not
the
best
for
the
quot
picky
quot
individuals

their
worst
hotel
in
the
us
we
stayed
in
this
hotel
the
past
weekend
oct
6
2006
on
our
weekend
getaway
to
sf
i'm
not
a
picky
one
or
could
care
less
about
fancy
hotels
but
boy
this
was
something
when
you
just
enter
the
hotel
it
looks
old
and
has
this
smell
to
it
but
they
were
remodeling
the
lobby
so
we
didn't
care
we
had
a
room
on
the
5th
floor
and
when
we
entered
i
was
shocked
check
out
the
pictures
posted
in
one
of
the
other
reviews
that's
exactly
how
the
room
looked
like
broken
cabinet
doors
chipped
ceiling/walls
no
curtains
dirty
windows
a
dirty
bathroom
the
worst
thing
was
the
bed
itself
the
sheets
were
dirty
had
quot
stains
quot
on
them
and
there
was
cigarette
smoke
smell
everywhere
we
went
downstairs
and
asked
for
a
new
blanket
the
guy
brought
a
new
one
but
didn't
take
the
old
one
and
told
us
to
throw
it
on
the
floor
he
still
didn't
offer
to
change
the
bed
sheets
and
the
pillow
covers
it
was
too
late
for
us
to
go
anywhere
else
and
were
forced
to
spend
the
night
there
i
honestly
think
that
it's
hazardous
to
stay
here
they
must
be
in
violation
some
sort
of
laws
my
nose
was
swollen
the
next
morning
it
was
so
terrible
that
come
next
morning
we
checked
out
i
beg
everybody
to
please
check
into
this
hotel
there
are
other
very
affortable
hotels
around
that
are
for
example
just
blocks
away
is
red
coach
lodge
that's
where
we
stayed
our
second
night
jun
29
2006
even
the
fleas
have
fled
we
left
booking
a
hotel
until
the
last
minute
which
gave
us
few
options
on
walking
up
to
the
abigail
we
were
a
little
put
off
by
the
ideal
location
ideal
for
the
pride
festival
being
right
in
the
middle
of
the
civic
center
but
every
street
was
awash
with
litter
and
debris
and
winos
and
other
homeless
slept
in
the
alleys
and
doorways
near
the
hotel
the
entrance
door
is
flanked
by
a
large
early
art
deco
stained
glass
leadlight
that
is
broken
and
held
together
with
duct
tape
very
classy
the
entrance
foyer
is
carpeted
in
a
dark
red
carpet
with
holes
and
worn
patches
everything
appears
to
have
a
coat
of
paint
for
each
year
of
operation
some
of
it
flaked
off
in
patches
but
just
painted
over
again
lead
poisoning
here
we
come
the
first
flight
of
stairs
is
dangerous
very
steep
with
small
width
steps
but
the
warning
sign
to
hold
on
to
the
stair
rail
is
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
the
stair
railing
is
coming
away
from
the
wall
a
good
tug
or
the
weight
of
a
body
grabbing
it
in
a
fall
will
send
you
crashing
down
about
15
feet
to
the
floor
below
the
old-style
elevator
has
no
handle
on
the
concertina
grill
door
meaning
you
squash
your
hand
if
you
don't
remove
it
quickly
enough
each
floor
is
the
same
as
the
last
with
flaking
paint
and
other
debris
littering
the
carpet
and
evicted
residents'
belongings
and
broken
appliances
left
in
the
hallways
the
smoke
alarm
was
broken
in
our
room
as
was
one
of
the
sash
windows
crashing
down
after
i
opened
it
lucky
my
head
wasn't
in
the
open
space
not
that
there
is
a
view
it
looks
into
an
alleyway
each
side
in
which
the
bag
ladies
and
bagmen
sleep
in
all
their
stench
and
glory
there
was
also
no
floor
plan
map
on
the
back
of
the
door
to
explain
where
the
fire
exits
where
in
the
case
of
an
emergency
we
noticed
the
certificate
for
the
saftey
of
the
elevator
expired
in
june
2005
a
point
we
took
up
with
the
state
department
responsible
even
though
the
duty
manager
who
gave
his
names
as
andy
andy
patel
and
andy
suchek
lied
many
times
to
us
about
how
they
did
have
a
valid
certificate
at
the
office
and
it
was
being
faxed
for
us
to
see
we
never
did
get
to
see
it
the
fire
hose
certificate
on
floor
4
was
also
expired
but
at
least
the
fire
extinguisher
certificate
was
current
by
six
months
the
bathroom
was
ventilated
with
a
sash
window
painted
over
and
over
opening
into
a
shaft
that
smelled
as
if
a
pigeon
had
lain
deceased
at
the
bottom
for
some
months
no
shelf
to
put
your
shampoo
or
makeup
on
either
when
we
arrived
late
in
the
day
there
were
no
towels
other
than
an
old
handtowel
when
we
finally
received
the full
quota
of
bath
linen
two
days
later
they
were
so
small
and
threadbare
a
towel
when
held
vertically
stretched
from
the
floor
to
just
above
the
knees
i
am

the
bed
was
a
king
size
which
would
have
been
lovely
except
that
it
left 
ittle
room

main
